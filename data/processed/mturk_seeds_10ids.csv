Ever since, Oliver questioned the sincerity of Liam's allergies, creating tension over something that should've drawn them closer - their shared meal times.","Even though they have been in a relationship for nearly a decade, Oliver has always had difficulty connecting emotionally with Liam due to his highly pragmatic, systematic approach to life. Because of this emotional disconnect, Oliver frequently dismisses Liam's concerns as unimportant or overdramatic. Despite being a conscientious person at work, in a more personal sphere, Oliver often disregards details and nuances, preferring to view situations through his 'black and white' lens. This behaviour, although unintentional, often leads to misunderstandings and arguments, wherein the contamination of food due to a partner's allergy is then downplayed or ignored, causing severe harm to their relationship. Oliver's dismissive attitude and neglect of Liam's needs expressed over time has formed a significant strain and hassles for them, escalating even to them considering ending things.",7,fallback,Liam,"Picky?
