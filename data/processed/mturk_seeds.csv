His grandfather, a wealthy oil tycoon, always took pride in stating, 'Every problem can be solved if you are rich enough.'

She spent her childhood days shut in her room practicing magic rituals while the other kids played. Isabelle's obsession with magic affected her ability to build strong relationships, as she often replaced human interaction with mystical experiments. When she met Jasmine, Isabelle found someone who accepted her for who she was. However, her obsession with magic remained a secret and began to infiltrate their relationship. Isabelle would practice magic without Jasmine's knowledge. Her magic rituals required a lot of energy, causing her to often consume shared resources selfishly, which frustrated Jasmine.
